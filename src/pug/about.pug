      h2 Who are we?
      p Input Labs Oy. (OsakeYhti√∂) is a small company established in Finland, Europe.
      p Founded in 2022 by 2 friends, both engineers and gamers: Marcos (born in Spain) and Michael (born in Germany). Later several friends joined as testers, idea givers and contributors. And now we are waiting for you.
      p You can talk with us on #[+a('TODO') Discord] anytime.

      h2 Our principles and goals
      p We embrace #[em open source], backward compatibility, right to repair, and privacy. We are disgusted by FOMO, predatory sales, and people imposing their preferences.
      p We are #[em not a startup], our goal is not to grow artificially, but to create a stable environment for research and development.
      p We #[em welcome and support] everyone in our community, we do not leave anyone behind.

      h2 Why not Kickstarter?
      p The very first reason, because Kickstarter is a platform for "pre-ordering" products, but Input Labs does not make products.
      p The other reason is a bit more philosophical, when someone "buys" something in Kickstarter, the company gets some money but they also get debt (with the backers), and debt is bad. We do not want to be in debt with anyone.
      p On the contrary, with Patreon the relation between the creator and the patron is much more healthy, transparent, and direct. We do what we love to do, and you can support us if you love it too.

      h2 Do you sell controllers?
      p Short answer: No.
      p Long answer: Becoming a manufacturer and/or online shop requires a lot of work, money investment, certifications, legal preparations, and it is possibly much more boring that what we do now.
      p So #[em maybe] in the future we could offer controller parts to buy directly from Input Labs website, though it depends on many factors.

      h2 What the logo means?
      p The logo is a sinusoidal wave representing an analog signal, being captured by code brackets (digital), in the shape of an hexagon, because hexagons are the #[a.egg(target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY') bestagons].
      p: del I'm not high, I promise.
      p When you think blue, green, or red, you associate these with some specific videogame brands, right? We don't settle with a single color, because #[em.wrap our favorite color is your favorite color], also we like rainbows, and RGB LED unicorn puke in all its PC gamer glory.

      h2 Why these funny animal names?
      p We named our 2 first devices Alpakka and Kapybara, these are actually spelt correctly in finnish language. That's our little tribute to Finland, a country that took us as their own fellows.
      p We also found funny that gaming companies are sometimes calling their products with 90's style radical animal names, such as the #[i "Cobra"], #[i "Black Puma"], or #[i "Death Hornet"] #[i (not actual names)].
      p Instead we go for the most huggable, weird, and cute animals; mocking corporation marketing. Please give us ideas for the next ones!
