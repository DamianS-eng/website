      h2 Complete DIY kits
      p To make more obvious which parts are required to build a complete DIY Alpakka controller, we introduced the concept of #[em Complete kits] into the shop.
      p These work similar to a guided configurator in which you select a few options, and the relevant parts are added to the shopping cart.
