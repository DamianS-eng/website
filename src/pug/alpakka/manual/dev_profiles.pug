  h2 Modify profiles
  hr

  p We are working in a simple method to modify profile on the #[+a('ctrl_app') Ctrl app], without the need to recompile the firmware, but at the moment the only way to edit profiles is to change the source code.
  p Meanwhile profiles are just C code located in the #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/tree/main/src/profiles') profiles/] folder, each profile in a single file containing a #[em Profile] object. And the profile having its buttons defined, a #[em Button] object for each button.
  p The parameters of the #[em Button] object are:
  ul
    li The #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/blob/main/src/headers/pin.h') pin identifier] of the physical button.
    li The desired #[em behavior] of the button. (See below).
    li A list of #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/blob/main/src/headers/hid.h') actions] to be performed, grouped with the #[em ACTIONS] macro for convenience.

  p Actions are either keyboard keys, mouse buttons, gamepad buttons, or special functions (procedures).

  +h3id('button_mode') Button modes
  p Depending on the mode there may be primary and secondary actions. The possible behaviors are:

  h3 Behavior timing
  p Also for now, Button behavior time thresholds are defined as config constants:
  ul
    li: em CFG_PRESS_DEBOUNCE
    li: em CFG_DOUBLE_PRESS
    li: em CFG_HOLD_EXCLUSIVE_TIME
    li: em CFG_HOLD_EXCLUSIVE_LONG_TIME
    li: em CFG_HOLD_OVERLAP_TIME
