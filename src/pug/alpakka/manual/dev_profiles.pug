  h2 Modify profiles
  hr

  p We are working in a simple method to create and load profiles via USB, without the need to recompile the firmware, but at the moment the only way to edit profiles is to change the source code.
  p Meanwhile profiles are just C code located in the #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/tree/main/src/profiles') profiles/] folder, each profile in a single file containing a #[em Profile] object. And the profile having its buttons defined, a #[em Button] object for each button.
  p The parameters of the #[em Button] object are:
  ul
    li The #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/blob/main/src/headers/pin.h') pin identifier] of the physical button.
    li The desired #[em behavior] of the button. (See below).
    li A list of #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/blob/main/src/headers/hid.h') actions] to be performed, grouped with the #[em ACTIONS] macro for convenience.

  p Actions are either keyboard keys, mouse buttons, gamepad buttons, or special functions (procedures).

  h3 Button behaviors
  p Depending on the behavior there may be primary and secondary actions. The possible behaviors are:

  table.manual.hdiv.col3
    tr
      td: b NORMAL
      th Primary actions
      th Secondary actions
    tr
      th Actions triggered

      td Yes
    tr
      th Actions released
      td When the profile is changed
      td When the button is released

  h3 Behavior timing
  p Also for now, Button behavior time thresholds are defined as config constants:
  ul
    li: em CFG_PRESS_DEBOUNCE
    li: em CFG_DOUBLE_PRESS
    li: em CFG_HOLD_EXCLUSIVE_TIME
    li: em CFG_HOLD_EXCLUSIVE_LONG_TIME
    li: em CFG_HOLD_OVERLAP_TIME
