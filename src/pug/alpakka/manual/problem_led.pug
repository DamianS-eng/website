  p While the controller is #[em establishing a wired connection] with the computer all LEDs will blink at once, if the blinking continues forever it means that the controller is not able to connect to the PC.
  p Potential solutions:
  ul
    li Unplug the controller and plug it back in.
    li Try using #[em another USB cable], be sure that the cable is not just a charging cable, and that it supports USB 2+.
    li Check that the computer is not suspended.

  ul
    li The controller is not #[+a('calibrate') calibrated] yet.
    li One (or both) of the #[em IMU / Gyro(s)] could not start, possibly because a problem with soldering.
  p Double-pressing the #[em Home #[+home]] button will make the LEDs to stop blinking, and ignore there issues until the next boot.
