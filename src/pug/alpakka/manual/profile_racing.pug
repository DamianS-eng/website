  p Made for racing (or driving) games as a replacement of a real steering wheel, so it is very recommended for simulation and simcade games such Assetto Corsa, Formula 1, Dirt Rally, Forza, Eurotruck Simulator, etc.
  p Depending on the game it might be better to switch to the #[+a('tune') Generic / DirectInput] mode, so the game takes the controller input as a generic steering wheel. As well as disabling in-game deadzone and any other kind of input filtering or assist.
