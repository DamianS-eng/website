  h3 Kapybara development starts now
  p Kapybara (finnish spell for #[+ax('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara') Capybara]) is the name for Input Labs' second reference design, a #[em single hand] controller more focused on accessibility usecases. We had plans to make the Kapybara as early as 2022 when Input Labs was founded, but the development of the Alpakka (our first controller) forced us to delay its development until now.

  p We are setting a development framework for the Kapybara that will be #[em very different than what we did for the Alpakka]. When we developed the Alpakka we had a #[em strong vision] for how a gyro-first controller should be, and how it should fit into the classic gamepad layout, therefore when we published the project and started getting feedback, such "late" feedback was mostly about how to nail the final design, but there were no radical re-designs.

  p On the contrary, with the Kapybara we are going to start gathering ideas from the community when we are still on the #[em drawing board], and we hope to get insights that only players with disabilities could give us. The concept is completely open at the moment, everything about it can be influenced by the #[em feedback from the workgroup].

  p In the new workgroup, we want testers to have a closer relationship with the developers, and more interaction in the process. This might include #[em 1on1 interviews] and video-sharing when using the prototypes (more on the expectations below). For this reason the number of testers will be much more limited (5~10) and more focused on the disability aspect.

  h3 Design goals (not final)
  ul
    li The controller should be usable with a #[em single hand].
    li #[em All games] that are playable with an Alpakka should be playable with a Kapybara, without losing any core functionality.
    li #[em Button density] on the Kapybara should be higher than in most other single-hand controllers. The number and layout of inputs will be decided during development.
    li The Kapybara could complement #[em other devices] (see use-cases below).
    li The Kapybara will use the #[em Marmota module] as core, reducing the development complexity (as if it was an Alpakka with different form factor).
    li The Kapybara may have a #[em jack 3.5mm] connector, so a #[em pedal] can be attached for additional inputs.
    li Reference design structure will be similar to Alpakka, with #[em open] 3D-printed models and PCB schematics.
    li Firmware and Ctrl app will support both Alpakka and Kapybara.


  hr
  h3 Open questions
  ul
    li Should the controller be #[em symmetric] and usable with either hand?, or should we have dedicated left-hand and right-hand versions? Is there any clever solution that have the benefits of an asymmetric case without the tradeoffs?.
    li Should the controller have a #[em strap]? It would keep the controller in position without requiring the ring and pinky fingers to be used to held the controller. Can we 3d-print straps with rubber materials such as TPU?.
    li Should the #[em ring and pinky fingers] be used for inputs (buttons)? They are the less dexterous fingers, and some people may have issues pressing buttons with them. Are the other 3 fingers (thumb, index, middle) enough for all the inputs required in complex games?.
    li Should the thumb be used for the #[em thumbstick]? this is the obvious solution, but the thumb is the most dexterous finger and maybe would be better to use the thumb for ABXY and the index finger for the thumbstick?.
    li What about the #[em second thumbstick]? should be placed in the back? in the front in a double stick arrangement? or not placed at all?.
    li Compared to an Alpakka, a Kapybara could have #[em reduced stability] while pressing buttons/triggers, which could lead to increased actuation motion or "gyro shake" (unintended rotation while pressing buttons).
    li Given the complex arrangement of buttons, can the PCB be designed with a #[em single board] / without requiring submodules nor #[em flex PCBs]?.
