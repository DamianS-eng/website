  h3 Firmware beta with alphanumeric input methods
  p As a continuation of the research documented on Alphanumeric input #[+a('alphanumeric_input') blog entry], we now implemented an early version of some input methods (Glyph-stick, Daisywheel, 8-slot quick chat macros, and on-screen keyboard shortcut) and released it as #[+ax(org.fw_release+'0.89.0-beta') Firmware 0.89.0-beta], we hope to get plenty of feedback from the community to iterate over these.
  p We also published a #[+ax('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVtkRMTe34o') demo video] showing how to use these.

  h3 Automated firmware build with GitHub actions
  p GitHub is now #[em automatically building] changes on the main branch and creating the final #[em .uf2] firmware file. Also we are able to build any branch or tag, triggering it from the UI, which is useful for releasing beta versions like the one above.
  p In before we did it manually, which required additional testing just to be sure there was no human error.
  p Additionally now everyone can verify the #[em metadata.txt] file in the build artifacts, and check the hash and job URL:
  pre: code.

  h3 Rolled out first feedback questionary for testers
  p We are getting feedback from official #[+a('hardware_testing') Testers] regarding the experience of figuring out how to build an Alpakka controller, sourcing the components, and the DIY process in general. We are organizing this feedback in a bit more structured way thanks to Google Forms, than the feedback we are usually collecting on Discord.
  p This will help us streamlining the process, and focus on the improvements that matter the most.
  hr

  h3 New kits in the shop
  p We introduced new articles available on the #[+ax(org.shop) Input Labs shop], including 3D-printed parts, so people without access to 3D-printers have now a fallback to get those, directly from the people with the most experience on printing these parts ;)
  p These are available multiple colors already, but we will introduce more colors later.
  p The new articles are:
  ul
    li 3D-printed front case.
    li 3D-printed back case.
    li 3D-printed buttons.
    li Soldering stand in recycled PLA.
    li Electronics components set.

  p Thanks a lot for the support! <br> - M&M <3
