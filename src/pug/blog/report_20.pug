  h3 New version of 3D models
  p To make them fit better, we improved the gap tolerances for the conductive hex, as well as the L4 / R4 triggers. We also slightly increased the size of the screw holes, to make assembly easier.
  p These changes, as well as some restructuring of the STLs are part of #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_case/releases/tag/0.95.1') release c0.95.1].

  h3 Boot diagnostics in Firmware and Ctrl App
  p In order to help with the diagnosis of problems, the #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/releases/tag/0.95.0') new firmware release] is now doing a quick self-check upon boot, indicating any problems with a new LED blink pattern.
  p If such problems occur, they easily be checked via the #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/ctrl/releases/tag/0.95.0') Ctrl app].
  p We also had to change device identifiers, so you may have to pair your Alpakka in the app again.
