  +news_header('14 June 2024', 'report_22', '')

  h3 Firmware and Ctrl app 0.96.0
  p We released #[+ax(org.fw_release+'0.96.0') f0.96.0] firmware, and Ctrl app #[+ax(org.ctrl_release+'0.96.0') a0.96.0]. The main new features are:
  ul
    li Unlocked 4 custom slot profiles. (#[em Home] + #[em DPad] double-press).
    li Button #[em double-press].
    li Profile copy/reset.
    li Profile #[em import/export] from/to #[em .ctrl] file. (Not compatible with 0.95.0)
    li Thumbstick #[em anti-deadzone].
    li Being able to reset controller config and profiles independently.

  h3 Wireless custom RF prototypes
  p As mentioned in previous reports, we started exploring alternatives other than the #[em Pico W], and since no other off-the-shelf board meets our requirements we are experimenting with #[em custom boards] and custom RF solutions.

  h4 RF test 1 board
  ul
    li A breakout board with a standalone #[em Nordic NRF24] and a 2.4GHz chip antenna.
    li An external microcontroller (or a Pico) uses the wireless solution via #[em SPI].
    li End-to-end latency: #[em ~1 millisecond].
    li Jitter: So small we cannot even measure it (possibly #[em microseconds] on average).
    li Connection range: #[em Excellent], able to transmit even from the next room.

  h4 RF test 2 board
  ul
    li A full board with #[em Raspberry RP2040] microcontroller, Nordic NRF24 and a 2.4GHz chip antenna.
    li #[em USB-C], but because a design error it was unusable.
    li #[em Snap-in connectors] so it can be attached to a main board without soldering.
    li Castellated pins for UART.
    li We realized that the USB-C receptacle was 0.2 millimeters too tall.

  h4 Connector breakout test
  ul
    li A simple connector-to-headers breakout board that allowed us to test the connectors.
    li Connectors have a very #[em satisfying snap-in click].
    li Connectors have very solid communication even when only partially plugged.
    li Physical connection is very robust but can move a bit if the USB-C cable is twisted. Would require additional 3D-printed support when attached to a full controller.

  h4 RF test 3 board
  ul
    li USB-C works as expected!
    li USB-C receptacle is sunk into the board for extra clearance.
    li #[em RP2040], flash memory, crystal clocks, linear regulator, and all other boring components works as expected.
    li Power bridge allows us to test battery charging with external components.
    li Unfortunately there was a #[em regression in wireless connection quality], the range was greatly reduced, and the antennas became very susceptible to angle changes.

  h4 Next steps
  ul
    li Introduce #[em Microchip MCP73871] battery charging chip that we tested previously (the space is very limited due to the connectors).
    li Investigate how to bring back great signal performance of the first prototype / Which changes are to blame for the reduction in connection quality.
    li Create an Alpakka board prototype with snap-in connectors instead of soldering pads.

  h3 Maria01 Pitching Day
  p #[+ax('https://maria.io') Maria01] (the startup campus in which Input Labs is located) organizes #[+ax('https://maria.io/events/maria-365-pitching-day/') 365 Pitching Day], an event in which startups showcase their work, not to actual VC companies, but as a #[em fun exercise] / competition (with judges!).
  p Michael was presenting Input Labs in an extremely short #[em 3 minutes] pitch + 3 minutes Q&A session format. It was fun!
