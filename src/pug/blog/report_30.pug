  h3 New Input Labs staff member
  p #[+ax('https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-bortnichenko-a8345044/') Maria Bortnichenko] joined Input Labs for a temporary assignment as #[em Strategy & Business developer], over the next few months she will help us analyzing the market, and how our devices align with it.
  p Additionally, she will explore partnerships with other companies, and potential investors.
  p Please join us in welcoming her to the team!.

  h3 Kapybara development is happening
  p After careful consideration of the applicants, we selected #[em 10 testers with disabilities], along with an additional 10+ testers without disabilities (mostly self-supported testers). The number of testers is significantly smaller than that for the testing phase of Alpakka, so we hope this allows for closer follow-up of the individual cases.
  p We prioritized testers with limb difference / amputation, neuromuscular disorders (dystrophy, sclerosis, palsy), or musculoskeletal disorders (arthritis, carpal syndrome, strain injury).
  p Most of the testers with disabilities have already participated in #[em 1-on-1 introductory meeting], so we got an initial understanding of their current setups and requirements.
  p From the 3 potential controller shapes (see #[+a('kapybara_development') previous post]), we decided to start experimenting with a symmetrical shape. We did a few iterations with different sizes and button placements, and printed a several non-functional mockups made with recycled PLA bio-plastic.

  h4 Layout so far (not final)

        h4 Top
        div Thumb finger
      td: ul
        li 2 mini-thumbsticks (second thumbstick might act as dpad or 8-directional).
        li 4 select buttons.
        li Scrollwheel.

      td
        h4 Front
        div Index finger
      td: ul
        li 6 bumper buttons.
        li Touch surface.
        li Big home button (so the thumb is free for profile switching and home shortcuts).
    tr
      td
        h4 Front
        div Middle finger
      td: ul
        li 2 triggers (can be used simultaneously or individually).
    tr
      td
        h4 Grip
        div Ring and pinky fingers / Palm
      td: ul
        li Optional mini finger-strap.
        li Optional grip extension (for bigger hands).




  p Soon we will distribute these #[em non-functional mockups] among testers to get early feedback. The most tricky aspects of the design we want to check with them are:
  ul
    li Size and ergonomics of the controller.
    li Button placement and angle of operation.
    li Grip extension for bigger hands (see picture above).
    li Finger-strap / full-strap.

  p We will adjust future mockups/prototypes based on the feedback from our testers, and maybe try other shapes and layouts.

  h3 1.1.0 update for Alpakka firmware and Ctrl app
  p It started as a small compilation of hotfixes after the v1 release, but ended up being a significant update with many fixes, quality of life improvements, and some minor new features.

  p Links and full changelogs:
  ul
    li #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/releases/tag/1.1.0') Firmware 1.1.0]
