  h3 Printables and Thingiverse
  p We created groups in #[+ax("https://www.printables.com/group/input-labs-VZE4mJR") Printables], and #[+ax("https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/input-labs") Thingiverse] for our designs (#[+ax("https://www.printables.com/model/351339-alpakka") Alpakka on Printables ], #[+ax("https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5748744") Alpakka on Thingiverse]).
  p This should make it considerably easier for people to find those designs, mix them up, and provide feedback.
