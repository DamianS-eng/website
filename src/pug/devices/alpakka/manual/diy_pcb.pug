  p The PCB schematics and layout are available at #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_pcb') Alpakka PCB] repository, along with the consolidated order files for the reference design.
  p We recommend to use a PCB prototyping service such as #[+ax('https://jlcpcb.com') JLCPCB], which manufacture cheap PCBs in low quantities, with the option to solder a good assortment of SMD (Surface Mount Devices) onto the board. Though is possible to use any other service of your preference.

  h3 Order from a PCB prototyping company
  p The steps to order a PCB from #[em JLCPCB] are:
  ol.spaced
    li Get order files (#[em .csv] and #[em .zip]) from #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_pcb/releases/latest') Releases], or by creating them yourself. #[i.dim (TODO PCB development page)]
    li Go to #[em JLCPCB] â†’ #[em Order now]
    li Upload gerber files: #[em jlcpcb_gerber.zip]
    li Wait until gerber files are processed.
    li Change #[em Remove Order Number] to #[em Specify a location]
    li Enable #[em PCB assembly] section.
    li Change #[em PCBA Qty] to desired number of PCBs with assembled components (minimum is 2).
    li Change #[em Tooling holes] to #[em Added by Customer]
    li Go to next page.
    li Upload BOM and CPL files: #[em jlcpcb_bom.csv] and #[em jlcpcb_cpl.csv]
    li Validate components (it could happen that some are sold out, and you may want to cancel the order).
    li Continue to checkout.
  p The minimum order in JLCPCB is 5 PCBs with 2 of them having front SMD components soldered on it. Which is a bit of a waste, but the 3 extra raw PCBs can be used to practice soldering if needed.
