      h2 All the control in your hand
      p The Kapybara controller is Input Labs' second reference design, to be used with a #[em single hand], and more focused in disability use-cases, yet it still have the same advanced gyro controls than the Alpakka.
      p Use it as a #[em standalone controller], and play any game single-handed without limitations.
      p Or use as a replacement for #[em WASD] (keyboard) while also using a mouse.

      h2 Next phase starts in 2025
      p We already solved most of the basic features by developing the #[+a('marmota') Marmota] module, which will also become the core of the Kapybara controller.
      p The next phase will be to create the #[em Kapybara workgroup], a small group of testers and contributors.
      p There is a lot of work to do figuring out the #[em physical layout] of the controller, how many buttons and inputs will have, and how they will be placed. We expect this work to start in #[em Q2 2025].

      h2 Use-cases
      p The Kapybara controller could be for you if:
      ul
        li It is difficult for you to use controllers designed for 2 hands.
        li You still want to use mouse, but is difficult for you to use a #[em keyboard].
        li You still want to use mouse, but your prefer an analog #[em thumbstick] over WASD keys.
