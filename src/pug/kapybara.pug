      h2 All the control in your hand
      p The Kapybara controller is Input Labs' second reference design, to be used with a #[em single hand], and more focused in disability use-cases, yet it still have the same advanced gyro controls than the Alpakka.
      p This controller is still in the conceptual phase, actual development will start later.
      p If you are interested in the Kapybara controller, remember you can #[+a('/contribute') Contribute] to Input Labs research with ideas, early feedback and more.

      h2 Use-cases
      p The Kapybara controller could be for you if:
      ul
        li Is difficult for you to use controllers designed for 2 hands.
        li You still want to use mouse, but is difficult for you to use a keyboard.
        li You still want to use mouse, but your prefer a thumbstick over WASD keys.
